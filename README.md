Large-Scale Comparative Analysis of Experimental and AlphaFold2 Predicted Structures

The analysis is conducted through a series of R notebooks, each designed to perform specific tasks:

•	Notebook_01_pipeline_02.Rmd: This notebook compiles the scripts used to generate the data for the study.

•	Notebook_02_pipeline_data_integration_02.Rmd: This notebook integrates the data generated in the previous pipeline.

•	Notebook_03_pipeline_data_analysis_02.Rmd: This notebook generates tables and figures based on the integrated data.
